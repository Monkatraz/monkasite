  <h1>This website is pretty slick</h1>
  <p>This website was a huge amount of fun to make. Here is a few technical details:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It's a static website - this is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify.</a></li>
    <li>This is really is all in one page. The JavaScript code inserts any relevant HTML directly into the main content area. The pages themselves are only partial and depend on index.html and its styling to display properly. It's pretty fun to watch the animations.</li>
    <li>There is no frameworks of any kind (if you don't count the <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>). There is an <a href="https://polyfill.io/v3/">automatic polyfill</a> script - but that's obviously just for compatibility.</li>
    <li>I am practically responsible for all of the site's markup and code (excluding the <span data-tip="Such as the boilerplate, modernizr.js, polyfill.io, and Google Analytics.">obvious stuff</span>) - the layout, styling, animations, and most of the JavaScript I created myself.</li>
    <li>This is my first website. I got initial CSS practice from making modules on the SCP Foundation wiki.</li>
    <li>Have I stroked my own ego enough? I'm just really happy with how this turned out!</li>
  </ul>

    <li>Implement full a11y, good practices were followed so it should be fairly simple</li>
