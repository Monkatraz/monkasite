    <p>I deeply love 3D animation and I am incredibly passionate about it. I got my start with the Source engine modding scene, specifically Counter-Strike: Source. I am particularly interested in first person animation for FPS games.</p>
    <p>Modding meant that I had to learn complex skills without a formal education. Accordingly, I am an entirely self-taught 3D animator. My animations are usually a sort of idealistic version of reality - for example, my firearm reload sequences are animated to be entirely accurate to how you would reload that specific firearm, but with motion that is punchy and evocative.</p>
    <p>On the matter of technical experience: My most recent experience is with using self-made IK rigs in Blender, however, I was originally animating with 3ds Max using the included Biped skeletal system. I prefer simplistic, decluttered rigs that allow me to animate more efficiently. I also prefer rigs that allow me to have a more tangible grasp on what the animations will look like once used in-game, so that I can fine-tune the visible experience.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that I am not a one-trick pony: I have considerable experience with nearly all facets of game design, including programming, materials, textures, 3D modelling, and more. I try to be flexible, and I always venture somewhat beyond the realm of just 3D animation when I am working on a project. I believe a good demonstration of flexibility is this website: I created this website's styling, animations, page load scripting, and layout entirely myself, using little copied code and no CSS, HTML, or JS frameworks. If you are interested in some of my other work, you can see some of this experience reflected in the (mostly amateur) work found in the "Models" and "Other Projects" sections on the navbar.</p>
    <p>As of writing, I have had no professional experience in the games industry. However, I believe I will quickly acclimate to a working environment and learn any necessary workflows swiftly. Additionally, I have a high expectation for the quality of my own work. Even if it requires great effort, I will make sure whatever I make is up to relevant standards and is generally done as 'correctly' as possible, using no shortcuts.</p>
